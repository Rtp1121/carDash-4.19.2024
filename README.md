# Digital CarDash Portfolio Project

Hello! This is my portfolio project for my CSE 2231 Software II class at The
Ohio State University!

## What is it?

Having a massive passion for cars and wanting to work for the automotive industry,
I set out to create a digital car dash. Unfortunately I did not have enough time
to code the graphic portion of the project, so I stuck to focusing on the basics
of component design. I based my component design on the OSU CSE Map components
which is found in the OSU CSE components library which can be
[downloaded here][components-jar]. I also used the latest JDK
[directly from Oracle's site][jdk-downloads].
